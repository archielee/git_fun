# git_fun

## Instructions
This is a toy repository for you to learn about branching and merging. Take a look at the `devel` and `rolling` branches. Your goal is to merge `rolling` into `devel`, and then merge `devel` into `master` using good Git practices (i.e. sane commit messages, resolving branch conflicts)
